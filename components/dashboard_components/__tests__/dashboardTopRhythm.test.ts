/**
 * The home screen's vertical rhythm, which is easy to break one class at a
 * time and hard to notice in a diff.
 *
 * Three blocks stack down the page — the balance header, the chart, the vials
 * — and the breaks between them have to be equal or the page reads as though
 * something has slipped. It did: the break between the search bar and the
 * chart was `pb-1`, 4px, while the chart left 12px above the vials (`mb-1` on
 * its own root plus `mb-2` on the wrapper). The search bar all but touched the
 * chart while the chart sat comfortably clear of the vials.
 *
 * These are class names, not measurements, so this cannot prove the screen
 * looks right — only that the four numbers still agree with each other. That
 * is the thing that drifted.
