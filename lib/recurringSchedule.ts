// "Is this charge one the app already knows is coming?"
//
// The capture pipeline could already recognise a subscription it had ALREADY
// RECORDED — a row sitting in the ledger within a few days of the capture. It
// could not recognise one it had merely SCHEDULED, and for a subscription that
// is the normal case: a monthly template's next occurrence does not exist as a
// row until its due date arrives (the executor only ever writes occurrences up
// to today, and the dashboard's future ones are display-only projections).
//
// So a Netflix charge announced by the bank on the 15th, with the monthly
// Netflix due on the 16th, matched nothing: the only real row was last month's,
// a month outside the pipeline's +/-3 day window. The charge was captured a
// second time, put in Review, and announced with a notification — for money the
// app was already expecting.
//
// This module walks a recurring row's schedule instead of looking only at where
// its row happens to sit, so "due tomorrow" counts as much as "recorded
// yesterday".
//
// Deliberately strict, because the consequence of a match is that a real bank
// charge is NOT written down:
//   - the amount must agree, near enough (see `amountsAgree`),
//   - the vendor must match fuzzily (the same test the rest of the pipeline
//     uses, so "Netflix.com" and "Netflix*" are one merchant),
//   - and an occurrence of the schedule must fall within a few days of the
//     capture.
// Two ordinary purchases at one merchant in the same week are real and must
// both survive; a subscription billing twice for the identical amount is not.
