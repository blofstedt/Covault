/**
 * Generate projected recurring transactions from existing transactions.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Monthly + Biweekly recurrences are projected.
 * - Current-month occurrences are included so on/before-today entries can solidify.
 * - Future occurrences stay projected until their date arrives.
 * - Project up to 3 months ahead as a rolling horizon.
 * - Display-only (never written to DB).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Only the EARLIEST transaction per (vendor, amount) group is
 * used as a projection source. The recurring executor spawns new real
 * transactions from each template (e.g. a Jul 13 Fizz spawns Aug 13, Sep 13,
 * ...). Without this filter, the projection function would generate
 * duplicate Sep 13 / Oct 13 / ... entries from both the original Jul 13
 * template AND the executor-spawned Aug 13 row, causing the dashboard
 * "red block" (remainingMoney went hugely negative because projectedCurrentMonth
 * was summed twice per template). See commit ed14cc3 for the bug history.
 *
 * Executor-spawned rows are also skipped explicitly as a belt-and-suspenders:
 * if a future change ever stores the original template under source='executor',
 * the projection would still be correctly attributed to the manual/notification
 * source rather than chained.

  // twice, once on its due date at $477.45 and once as the captured charge a
  // day later at $477.46. So an occurrence is now cancelled by a real row that
  // merely looks like the same charge: the merchant fuzzily, the amount near
  // enough, the date within a few days.
  //
  // Paired off one-to-one, closest first, because a real row may only cancel
  // ONE occurrence. The household has two Fizz charges a month three days
  // apart; without the pairing, whichever arrived first would cancel both and
  // the other charge would drop out of the month until it too was captured.
