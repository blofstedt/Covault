/**
 * One purchase, one row — however many ways the bank announces it.
 *
 * Most banks send both a push and an email for the same charge, and the two are
 * not remotely the same string, so every fingerprint check in the pipeline sees
 * two unrelated events. The near-duplicate check almost catches it and then
 * misses: it demands the same day and the same cent, while an email routinely
 * arrives the next morning and occasionally rounds differently.
 *
 * The rule that closes it has to be careful in both directions. Dropping too
 * eagerly loses a real purchase — which is the failure this app treats as
 * unacceptable — and dropping too little puts every charge on the dashboard
 * twice.
