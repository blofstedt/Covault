/**
 * The Discretionary Shield actually takes a chunk out of Leisure.
 *
 * It shipped inert: the toggle saved, the vial knew how to draw a deduction,
 * and the dashboard passed a literal `0` between them — so switching the
 * shield on changed nothing on screen, which is exactly what a working feature
 * with nothing to absorb looks like. These tests pin the amount down, and pin
 * the two rules that keep it explainable: every dollar it removes from Leisure
 * is a dollar another vial ON SCREEN is over by, and the shield never rewrites
 * that other vial to look as though it came in under its limit.
