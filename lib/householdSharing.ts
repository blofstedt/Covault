// The two questions a couple actually has, which linking used to answer with
// one word.
//
//   1. WHOSE BUDGETS?  Most couples keep their own lines — his $300 of fuel,
//      her $200 of personal — drawn against one household income. Some pool
//      everything into one set. Linking used to assume the second and deliver
//      neither: each phone showed its own limits measured against the
//      household's combined spending, so the same grocery total ran against a
//      different line on each screen and one person saw a full vial while the
//      other saw it overflowing.
//
//   2. HOW MUCH DETAIL?  Seeing that a partner spent $95 on Personal is a
//      different thing from seeing that it was a lash bar. Sharing a budget
//      should not require sharing every merchant, and a couple who want the
//      first should not have to decline the whole feature to avoid the second.
//
// The two are independent: you can pool budgets and still keep your merchants
// to yourself, or keep separate lines and share every purchase.
//
// The income question is NOT a third setting. A linked household has one
// income — both figures added — in either mode, because "Our Remaining
// Balance" is a claim about the household's money and there is no reading of
// it where one person's salary is the whole of it.
